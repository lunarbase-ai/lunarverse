# Cytoscape Visualizer

## Overview

The **Cytoscape Visualizer** is a software component designed to receive a Cytoscape formatted JSON and create a graph visualization. This component leverages the Cytoscape.js library to render interactive and informative graph visualizations based on the provided JSON data.

## Features

- Parses Cytoscape formatted JSON data.
- Generates an interactive graph visualization.
- Utilizes Cytoscape.js for robust and customizable graph rendering.

## Inputs

The Cytoscape Visualizer expects the following input:

- **Cytoscape JSON**: A JSON object formatted according to Cytoscape.js specifications. This JSON should define the nodes, edges, and styling information necessary for creating the graph visualization.

  **Input Type**: `JSON`

## Output

The output of the Cytoscape Visualizer is a graph visualization rendered using Cytoscape.js. The output type is represented as:

- **Output Type**: `CYTOSCAPE`

## Configuration Parameters

The Cytoscape Visualizer does not require any additional configuration parameters. It operates solely based on the provided Cytoscape formatted JSON data.

## Usage

To use the Cytoscape Visualizer, provide it with a Cytoscape formatted JSON object. The component will process this JSON and render an interactive graph visualization accordingly.

## Example

Here is a brief overview of how the Cytoscape JSON might be structured:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "data": { "id": "a" } },
    { "data": { "id": "b" } }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "data": { "source": "a", "target": "b" } }
  ]
}
```

This JSON structure defines a simple graph with two nodes and one edge connecting them.

## Dependencies

The Cytoscape Visualizer relies on the Cytoscape.js library for rendering the graph visualizations. Ensure that this library is available and properly configured in your environment.
