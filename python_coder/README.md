# Python Coder Component

## Description

The **Python Coder** component is designed to perform customized Python code execution. It processes a string of Python code provided as input, executes it, and outputs the value assigned to the variable `result` within the code. This component is particularly useful for dynamically evaluating Python expressions or performing operations that depend on runtime code execution.

## Inputs

- `Code` (str): A string of the Python code to execute. The Python code can be inputted manually by the user. Ensure that the code includes the assignment of a value to the variable `result`, as this is what the component will output.

## Outputs

- Output (Any): The value of the variable `result` in the Python code after execution. The output type can vary depending on the value assigned to `result` in the executed code.

## Configuration Parameters

- `openai_api_key` (str): The API key for authenticating with the OpenAI service, if required.
- `openai_api_base` (str): The base URL for the OpenAI API, if different from the default.

## Usage

To use the Python Coder component, provide the Python code as a string input. Ensure that your code assigns a value to a variable named `result`. The component will execute the code and return the value of `result`.

### Example:

If the input code is:
```python
x = 5
y = 10
result = x + y
```

The output will be:
```python
15
```

## Notes

- Ensure your Python code is syntactically correct and does not include any operations that could cause unintended side effects or security issues.
- The component will only return the value of the variable `result`. If `result` is not defined in the provided code, the execution will result in an error.
- The execution environment for the code may have limitations or restrictions depending on the deployment context of this component.

## Security Considerations

When using this component, especially in environments where the input code can be provided by untrusted users, be aware of the potential for malicious code execution. Consider implementing appropriate security measures such as code sanitization, execution time limits, and restricted execution environments.

This component provides a flexible and powerful way to dynamically execute Python code and retrieve the results, making it a valuable tool for various applications that require on-the-fly code evaluation.
