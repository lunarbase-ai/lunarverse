# OpenAI Prompt Component

## Overview

The **OpenAI Prompt** component connects to OpenAI's API to run natural language prompts and outputs the result as text. This component facilitates interaction with OpenAI's language models, allowing you to provide a prompt and receive a generated response.

## Description

The OpenAI Prompt component enables users to send prompts to OpenAI's language models and retrieve the generated text responses. This component is particularly useful for applications requiring natural language understanding and generation.

### Output

- **Output (str):** The answer provided by the Language Model (LLM) to the prompt.

## Inputs

- **Prompt (TEMPLATE):** A string template containing the natural language prompt to be sent to the OpenAI API.

## Output

- **TEXT:** The text response generated by the OpenAI language model based on the provided prompt.

## Configuration Parameters

To use the OpenAI Prompt component, you need to configure the following parameters:

- **openai_api_key:** Your API key for authenticating with the OpenAI API.
- **model_name:** The name of the OpenAI model you wish to use for generating responses (e.g., `text-davinci-003`).
- **openai_api_base:** The base URL for the OpenAI API endpoint.

## Usage

This component is designed for ease of use, allowing you to quickly integrate OpenAI's powerful language models into your applications. Simply provide the necessary configuration parameters, input your prompt, and retrieve the generated response text.

## Notes

- Ensure your OpenAI API key is kept secure and not exposed in your code.
- Be mindful of the rate limits and usage policies set by OpenAI to avoid any disruptions in service.
- The quality and relevance of the generated response can vary based on the prompt and the chosen model. Experiment with different prompts and models to achieve the best results for your use case.
