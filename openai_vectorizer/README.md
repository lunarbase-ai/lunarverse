# OpenAI Vectorizer

## Description

The OpenAI Vectorizer component leverages OpenAI models to encode texts into numerical embeddings. These embeddings are useful for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text similarity, clustering, and classification. The output is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the original text and its corresponding embeddings.

## Inputs

- **Text list** (LIST): A list of text items that you want to encode. Each item in the list should be a string.

## Outputs

- **Embeddings** (List[dict]): A list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains:
  - `text` (str): The original text.
  - `embeddings` (List[Union[float, int]]): The numerical embeddings generated by the OpenAI model for the corresponding text item.

## Configuration Parameters

- **model**: The specific OpenAI model to be used for encoding the texts. This parameter determines which pre-trained model will generate the embeddings.
- **openai_api_key**: The API key required to authenticate requests to the OpenAI service. This key is necessary to access the OpenAI model and generate embeddings.

## Example Configuration

To use the OpenAI Vectorizer, you need to specify the following configuration parameters:

- `model`: e.g., "text-embedding-ada-002"
- `openai_api_key`: Your OpenAI API key provided by OpenAI.

These parameters should be configured before running the component to ensure successful encoding of the input texts.
