# SBGN Visualizer

## Overview
The **SBGN Visualizer** is a software component designed to convert a Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) XML file into a graph visualization. This component is particularly useful for researchers and developers working in the field of computational biology, enabling them to easily visualize complex biological networks.

## Features
- **SBGN XML Parsing**: Efficiently parses SBGN XML strings to extract biological network information.
- **Graph Visualization**: Creates a detailed graphical representation of the biological network.
- **Node Selection**: Allows users to specify nodes of interest for focused analysis and visualization.

## Input Types
The **SBGN Visualizer** component accepts the following input types:

- **SBGN XML string (TEXT)**: A string containing the SBGN XML data.
- **Selected node ids (LIST)**: A list of node identifiers to highlight or focus on within the graph.

## Output Type
The output of the **SBGN Visualizer** component is:

- **BSGN_GRAPH**: A graphical representation of the biological network described by the SBGN XML input.

## Configuration Parameters
This component does not require any additional configuration parameters.

## How It Works
1. **Input Reception**: The component receives a string containing the SBGN XML data and an optional list of node IDs.
2. **Parsing**: The SBGN XML string is parsed to extract the relevant biological network information.
3. **Visualization**: A graph is generated to visually represent the biological network. If a list of node IDs is provided, these nodes will be highlighted or focused on within the graph.
4. **Output Generation**: The resulting graph visualization is output as a BSGN_GRAPH type.

## Use Cases
- **Biological Research**: Visualizing complex biological pathways and networks to better understand biological processes.
- **Data Analysis**: Highlighting specific nodes of interest within a larger network for targeted analysis.
- **Educational Tools**: Creating visual aids for teaching systems biology and network biology concepts.

## Dependencies
To ensure seamless operation, the **SBGN Visualizer** component may require the following dependencies:
- Libraries for XML parsing
- Graph visualization libraries

Please refer to the component's implementation for specific library requirements.

## Conclusion
The **SBGN Visualizer** is a powerful tool for transforming SBGN XML representations into clear and informative graph visualizations. Its simplicity and focus on essential inputs make
